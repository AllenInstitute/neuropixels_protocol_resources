# Neuropixels Protocol Resources

Notebooks and design files for Allen Brain Observatory experimental procedures described in Durand, Ramirez, Heller et al. (2022) protocol paper.

See [Siegle, Jia et al. (2021) *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03171-x) for an example application of these procedures.


## Design files

![Headframe image](Design files/0160-100-10_A.png)

*Headframe* (Part #160-100-10_A) - titanium piece used for head fixation.

![Headframe well](Design files/0160-200-45.png)

*Headframe well* (Part #160-200-45) - 3D printed well attached to the headframe. Similar to the well used in 2P experiments, but includes a mating surface for the insertion window and a slot for a ground pin.

![Headframe cap](Design files/0160-200-37.png)

*Headframe cap* (Part #0160-200-37) - 3D printed cap that screws into the headframe well to protect the craniotomy between experiments.

![Protective cone](Design files/0160-200-50.png)

*Protective cone* (Part #0160-200-50) - 3D printed cone that protects the probes and manipulators from the mouse's tail during the experiment. Also includes a channel for a mating gold pin for grounding.


## Notebooks

[*Probe targeting.ipynb*](Notebooks/Probe targeting.ipynb) - Following a calibration procedure, outputs the coordinates required to hit targets in a global coordinate space.
